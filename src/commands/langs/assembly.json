      "name": "Advantages",
      "value": "- Faster in speed as it will be extremely optimized to use only necessary resources\n- Efficient use of memory\n- High level of control\n- Access registers and memory in hardware\n- Don't need to rely on compilers to optimize the code\n- Assemmbler bugs are much easier to identify and fix compared to compiler bugs"
